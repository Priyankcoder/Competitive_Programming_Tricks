Fermat’s little theorem

Fermat’s little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, 
the number (a power p) – a is an integer multiple of p.

Here p is a prime number
a power p ≡ a (mod p).

Special Case: If a is not divisible by p, Fermat’s little theorem is equivalent to the 
statement that (a power p-1)-1 is an integer multiple of p.



(a power p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)
OR
(a power p-1) % p = 1
Here a is not divisible by p.


Take an Example How Fermat’s little theorem works
Examples:

 P = an integer Prime number   
 a = an integer which is not multiple of P  
 Let a = 2 and P = 17 
 
 According to Fermat's little theorem 
  2 power (17 - 1)     ≡ 1 mod(17)
 we got  65536 % 17 ≡ 1   
 that mean (65536-1) is an multiple of 17 
Use of Fermat’s little theorem

If we know m is prime, then we can also use Fermats’s little theorem to find the inverse.

a power (m-1) ≡ 1 (mod m)
If we multiply both sides with a-1, we get

a power (-1) ≡ (a power (m-2)) (mod m)
